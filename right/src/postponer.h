/**
 * Postponer function:
 *
 * Postponer is activated by `PostponeNCycles(n)` call, which makes the Postponer
 * active for next at least n cycles. This means that for at least next n update
 * cycles, key activations will be stored into Postponer's queue rather than
 * executed by usb_report_updater.
 *
 * The `n` from `PostponeNCycles(n)` is stored into `cycles_until_activation`,
 * and is decremented every update cycle. Once `cycles_until_activation` reaches
 * zero, Postponer starts replaying enqueued events at pace one event every two
 * cycles. This allows every key to go through its entire lifecycle properly.
 *
 * Postponer becomes inactive once cycles_until_activation is zero and event queue
 * is empty.
