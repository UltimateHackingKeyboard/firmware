/**
 * General logic.
 *
 * There are three types of actions:
 * - layer holds
 * - layer toggles
 * - secondary layer hold
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Superiority:
 *   - Toggled layers are superior to layer holds.
 * - Evaluation:
 *   - Toggles are triggered by key presses/releases and behave as standard actions.
 *   - Standard holds are evaluated continuously in "background" irrespectively
 *     of currently active layer.
 * - Behaviour expectations:
 *   - Layer switch should never prevent non-base-layer action from happening.
 *   - If two holds are activated concurrently, the first one is superior to the second one.
 *     Yet, when the first one is released, the second one takes place.
 *
 * Secondary roles:
 * - if possible, secondary role holds behave as standard holds (experimental, toggled by SECONDARY_AS_REGULAR_HOLD).
 *   Otherwise:
 *   - Secondary layer hold is superior to standard holds.
 *   - Secondary layer hold is triggered by press/release and behaves as standard actions.
