# Reference manual

This file contains (semi)formal documentation of all features of the extended engine. Please note:

- You might want to start by reading [user-guide manual](user-guide.md), especially the point on understanding the docs.

- The grammar is meant to be the ultimate information source. Not all commands or parameters are described in the later text.

- Most values in the following text are just recommended ranges. The firmware will usually accept even values outside these ranges.

### Error handling

Whenever a garbled command is encountered, `ERR` will light up on the display, and details are appended to the error buffer. You can retrieve it by running a `printStatus` macro command over a focused text editor.

Errors have the following format:

```
{Error|Warning} at <macro name> <action index>/<line>: <message>: <failed command>
```

## Macro events

Macro events allow hooking special behaviour, such as applying a specific configuration to events. This is done via a special naming scheme. Currently, the following names are supported:

    $onInit
    $onKeymapChange {KEYMAPID|any}
    $onLayerChange {LAYERID|any}
    $onKeymapLayerChange KEYMAPID LAYERID
    $onCapsLockStateChange
    $onNumLockStateChange
    $onScrollLockStateChange
    $onError
    $onJoin
    $onSplit

Please note that:
  - under Linux, scroll lock is disabled by default. As a consequence, the macro event does not trigger.
  - under MacOS, scroll lock dims the screen but does not toggle the scroll lock state. As a consequence, the macro event does not trigger.

I.e., if you want to customize the acceleration driver for your trackball module on keymap QWR, create a macro named `$onKeymapChange QWR`, with content e.g.:

    set module.trackball.baseSpeed 0.5
    set module.trackball.speed 1.0
    set module.trackball.xceleration 1.0

(Also note, that the above will *not* restore original settings when you leave the keymap. You will need another macro event for that.)

## Macro commands

The following grammar is supported:

Operator | syntax
 --- | ---
rules - need to be expanded | `UPPERCASE_IDENTIFIERS`
obligatory group | `{ ... }`
optional group | `[ ... ]`
one or more | `[ ... ]+`
any number | `[ ... ]*`
choice | `A \| B`
resolved text | `text`
human-readable description | `<hint>`
human-readable description, backed by a specific rule | `<hint (RULE)>`

### Uncategorized commands:

- `setLedTxt <time> { STRING | VALUE }` will set led display to the supplemented text and block for the given time before updating display back to default value.
    - If the given time is zero, i.e. `<time> = 0`, the led text will be set indefinitely (until the display is refreshed by other text) and this command will return immediately.
    - If `VALUE` is given (e.g., `$keystrokeDelay`), will be shown in notation that shows first two significant digits and a letter denoting floating point shift. E.g., `A23 = 2.3`, `Y23 = -0.23`, `23B = 2300`...
    - If location is given, the text will be show there. For uhk60, only "abbrev" location is valid (and default); others will be ignored. For uhk80, "notification" is default, and "abbrev" is ignored. E.g.:
      - `setLedTxt 2000 abbrev "HLW" "Hello world!"` will display `HLW` on uhk60 and `Hello world!` on uhk80
      - `setLedTxt 2000 leftStatus "0" rightStatus "35 T"` will not display anything on uhk60 and change the leftStatus and rightStatus on uhk80
- `progressHue` or better `autoRepeat progressHue` will slowly adjust constantRGB value in order to rotate the per-key-RGB backlight through all hues.
- `resetTrackpoint` resets the internal trackpoint board. Can be used to recover the trackpoint from drift conditions. Drifts usually happen if you keep the cursor moving at slow constant speeds, because of the boards's internal adaptive calibration. Since the board's parameters cannot be altered, the only way around is or you to learn not to do the type of movement which triggers them.
- `i2cBaudRate <baud rate, default 100000(INT)>` sets i2c baud rate. Lowering this value may improve module reliability, while increasing latency.
- `{|}` Braces allow grouping multiple commands as if they were a single command. Please note that from the point of view of the engine, braces are (almost) regular commands, and have to be followed by newlines like any other command. Therefore idioms like `} else {` are not possible at the moment.
- `powerMode [toggle] { wake | lock | sleep | shutdown }`
  - `lock` disables all leds, disables USB output. Connections remain active. Device can be woken up by either pressing s+f and j+l keys, or by another macro call. This mode is experimental.
  - `sleep` reboots the keyboard into a low power mode, that still scans keys and can be woken up by s+f or j+l keys.
  - `shutdown` is used by uhk when its battery runs out. You can wake up by plugging in the USB cable. It is not designed to be used directly.
  - `wake` wakes up the device from "any" sleep mode that doesn't disable macro engine and the half link.
  - Further rules:
    - If a sleep mode is activated while another sleep mode is active, the deeper of them will be activated.
    - If `toggle` is specified and the device is already in the (exact) sleep mode, it will wake the device instead.
- `reboot` - reboots the right half, and in case of uhk80, also left half and connected dongles. (Uhk60 left half shouldn't need reboot as it is a simple module.)

### Bluetooth:
- `bluetooth [toggle] { pair | advertise | noAdvertise }` controls advertising for hid devices - this doesn't affect dongle and left half advertising.
  - `pair` will start pairing mode. The device will be discoverable for 2 minutes, and will refuse connections from all known devices so that it is possible to pair a new device.
  - `advertise` will make the device discoverable for 2 minutes. This allows ble hid devices to either connect or pair.
  - `noAdvertise` will disable alwaysAdvertiseHid and stop advertising.
  - `toggle` will make keyboard enter the default mode if the supplied mode is active.
- `switchHost { last | next | previous | <host connection name (IDENTIFIER)> | <host connection name (STRING)> }` switches the host connection. 
  - `previous | next` switch to the next currently connected host in the list of hosts. E.g., this iterates over blue dongles, as well as some other connections.
  - `last` switches to the previously active host connection. For instance the last in `switchHost "pc"; switchHost "laptop"; switchHost last` switches to "pc".
  - `<host connection identifier>` switches to the host connection with the given name. If the connection is not available, UHK will reserve a connection slot for this host. Therefore it is possible to connect to violet dongles too. 
  - See the bluetooth section for more information.

### Triggering keyboard actions (pressing keys, clicking, etc.):

- `write <custom text>` will type the provided string. Strings are single quote- (for literal strings) or double quote- (for interpolated strings) enclosed. E.g., `write "keystrokeDelay is $keystrokeDelay, 1+1=$(1+1)\n"`, or `'$ will show as literal dollar sign.'`.
- `startMouse/stopMouse` start/stop corresponding mouse action. E.g., `startMouse move left`
- `pressKey|holdKey|tapKey|releaseKey|toggleKey` Presses/holds/taps/releases the provided scancode. E.g., `pressKey mouseBtnLeft`, `tapKey LC-v` (Left Control + (lowercase) v), `tapKey CS-f5` (Ctrl + Shift + F5), `LS-` (just tap left Shift).
  - **press** means adding the scancode into a list of "active keys" and continuing the macro. The key is released once the macro ends. I.e., if the command is not followed by any sort of delay, the key will be released again almost immediately.
  - **release** means removing the scancode from the list of "active keys". I.e., it negates the effect of `pressKey` within the same macro. This does not affect scancodes emitted by different keyboard actions, however for user friendliness it does cancel `persistent` presses.
  - **tap** means pressing a key (more precisely, activating the scancode) and immediately releasing it again
  - **hold** means pressing the key, waiting until the key which activated the macro is released, and then releasing the key again. I.e., `holdKey <x>` is equivalent to `pressKey <x>; delayUntilRelease; releaseKey <x>`, while `tapKey <x>` is equivalent to `pressKey <x>; releaseKey <x>`.
  - **toggle** will check if the shortcut is pressed in this macro's reports. If it is, it will deactivate the shortcut, otherwise it will activate it. This always acts on persistent reports.
  - **persistent** argument will use global reports. These reports can be accessed from any macro and will not be cleared when the macro ends. This is useful for long-term key toggling. E.g., `toggleKey persistent LS` acts similar to caps lock.
  - `tapKeySeq` can be used for executing custom sequences. The default action for each shortcut in the sequence is tap. Other actions can be specified using `MODMASK`. E.g.:
    - `CS-u 1 2 3 space` - control shift U + number + space - linux shortcut for a custom unicode character.
    - `pA- tab tab rA-` - tap alt tab twice to bring forward the second background window.
  - `MODMASK` meaning:
    - `{S|C|A|G}` - Shift Control Alt Gui. (Windows, Super, and Gui are the same thing.)
    - `[L|R]` - Left Right (which hand side modifier should be used) E.g. `holdKey RA-c` (right alt + c).
    - `{s|i|o}` - modifiers (ctrl, alt, shift, gui) exist in three composition modes within UHK - sticky, input, output:
        - **sticky modifiers** are modifiers of composite shortcuts. These are applied only until the next (physical) key press. In certain contexts, they will take effect even after their activation key is released (e.g., to support alt + tab on non-base layers, you can do `holdKey sLA-tab`).
        - **input modifiers** are queried by `ifMod` conditions, and can be suppressed by `suppressMods`. E.g. `holdKey iLS`.
        - **output modifiers** are ignored by `ifMod` conditions, and are not suppressed by `suppressMods`.

      By default:
        - modifiers of normal non-macro scancode actions are treated as **sticky** when accompanied by a scancode.
        - normal non-macro modifiers (not accompanied by a scancode) are treated as **input** by default.
        - macro modifiers are treated as **output**.
    - `{p|r|h|t}` - press release hold tap - by default corresponds to the command used to invoke the sequence, but can be overridden for any.
    - windows, super, gui - all these are different names for the same key. For the sake of consistency, we choose `gui`.

### Control flow, macro execution (aka "functions"):

- `goTo ADDRESS` will go to action index int. Actions are indexed from zero. See `ADDRESS`
- `repeatFor <variable name> ADDRESS` - abbreviation to simplify cycles. Will decrement the supplemented variable and perform `goTo` to `adr` if the value is still greater than zero. Intended use case - place after command which is to be repeated with the variable containing the number of repeats and address `($currentAddress-1)` (or similar).
- `break` will terminate innermost while loop. If there is no enclosing while loop, then this will terminate the current macro.
- `exit` will terminate the current macro
- `noOp` does nothing - i.e., stops macro for exactly one update cycle and then continues.
- `yield` forces macro to yield, if blocking scheduler is used. With preemptive scheduler acts just as `noOp`.
- `exec MACRONAME` will execute the macro in the current state slot. I.e., the macro will be executed in the current context and will *not* return. The first action of the called macro is executed within the same event loop cycle.
- `call MACRONAME` will execute another macro in a new state slot and enters sleep mode. After the called macro finishes, the control returns to the caller macro. First action of the called macro is executed within the same eventloop cycle. The called macro has its own context (e.g., its own ifInterrupted flag, its own postponing counter and flags etc.) Beware, the state pool is small - do not use deep call trees!
- `fork MACRONAME` will execute another macro in a new state slot, without entering sleep mode.
- `stopAllMacros` interrupts all macros.

### Status buffer/Debugging tools

- `printStatus` will "type" content of status buffer (256 or 1024 chars, depends on my mood) on the keyboard. Mainly for debug purposes.
- `setStatus STRING` will append STRING to the status buffer, if there is enough space for that. This text can then be printed by `printStatus`.
- `clearStatus` will clear the buffer.
- `statsRuntime` will output information about runtime of current macro into the status buffer. The time is measured before the printing mechanism is initiated.
- `statsLayerStack` will output information about layer stack (into the buffer).
- `statsPostponerStack` will output information about postponer queue (into the buffer).
- `statsActiveKeys` will output all active keys and their states (into the buffer).
- `statsActiveMacros` will output all active macros (into the buffer).
- `statsRecordKeyTiming` will write timing information of pressed and released keys into status buffer until invoked again.
- `diagnose` will deactivate all keys and macros and print diagnostic information into the status buffer.
- `set emergencyKey KEYID` will make the one key be ignored by postponing mechanisms. `diagnose` command on such key can be used to recover keyboard from conditions like infinite postponing loop...

### Delays:

- `delayUntil <timeout>` sleeps the macro until timeout (in ms) is reached.
- `delayUntilRelease` sleeps the macro until its activation key is released. Can be used to set action on key release.
- `delayUntilReleaseMax <timeout>` same as `delayUntilRelease`, but is also broken when timeout (in ms) is reached.

### Layer/Keymap switching:

Layer/Keymap switching mechanism allows toggling/switching of keymaps or layers. We keep layer records in a stack of limited size, which can be used for nested toggling and/or holds.

special ids:
- `previous` refers to the second stack record (i.e., `stackTop-1`)
- `last` always refers to the previously used layer/keymap (i.e., `stackTop-1` or `stackTop+1`)

terminology:
- switch means loading the target keymap and resetting layer-switching context
- toggle refers to activating a layer and remaining there (plus the activated layer is pushed onto the layer stack)
- hold refers to activating a layer, waiting until the key is released, and then switching back (plus the activated layer is pushed onto the layer stack and then removed again)

implementation details:
- layer stack contains information about switch type (held or toggle) and a boolean which indicates whether the record is active. Once hold ends or untoggle is issued, the corresponding record (not necessarily the top record) is marked as "inactive". Whenever some record is marked inactive, all inactive records are popped from the top of the stack.
- the stack contains both layer id and keymap id. If keymap ids of previous/current records do not match, the full keymap is reloaded.

Commands:
- `switchKeymap` will load the keymap by its abbreviation and reset the stack.
- `toggleLayer` toggles the layer.
- `untoggleLayer` pops topmost non-held layer from the stack. (I.e., untoggles layer which was toggled via "toggle" or "switch" feature.)
- `toggleKeymapLayer` toggles layer from different keymap.
- `holdLayer LAYERID` mostly corresponds to the sequence `toggleLayer <layer>; delayUntilRelease; untoggleLayer`, except for more elaborate conflict resolution (releasing holds in incorrect order).
- `holdKeymapLayer KEYMAPID LAYERID` just as holdLayer, but allows referring to layer of different keymap. This reloads the entire keymap, so it may be very inefficient.
- `holdLayerMax/holdKeymapLayerMax` will timeout after <timeout> ms if no action is performed in that time.
- `ifPrimary/ifSecondary [ simpleStrategy | advancedStrategy ] ... COMMAND` will wait until the firmware can distinguish whether primary or secondary action should be activated and then either execute `COMMAND` or skip it.

### Layer/Keymap loading manipulation / shared layers:

Following commands allow altering current keymap in RAM. Typically, you can use this to share layers among keymaps, or modify/construct your layers/keymaps on the fly out of pre-fabricated pieces (e.g., changing ijkl to arrows by a shortcut).

These alterations will last only until keymap is reloaded. I.e., switching keymap, or issuing `holdKeymapLayer` will destroy all changes done by following commands.

- `replaceLayer <target layer (LAYERID)> <source keymap (KEYMAPID)> <source layer (LAYERID)>` will replace one layer with a layer from another keymap. You can use this to share layers across keymaps. For instance, add `replaceLayer mod QWR fn` to your `$onKeymapChange QTY` macro event to "permanently" replace the mod layer of your QTY keymap by the fn layer of the QWR keymap
- `overlayLayer <target layer (LAYERID)> <source keymap (KEYMAPID)> <source layer (LAYERID)>` will take defined actions from the source layer and apply them on the target layer. Assume `ARR base` layer contains just arrows on `ijkl` keys. Now, in your QWERTY layout, call `overlayLayer base ARR base` and you get QWERTY that has arrows on `ijkl`.
- `overlayKeymap KEYMAPID` as `overlayLayer`, but overlays all layers by corresponding layers of the provided keymap.

### Postponing mechanisms.

We allow postponing key activations in order to allow deciding between some scenarios depending on the next pressed key and then activating the keys pressed in "past" in the newly determined context. The postponing mechanism happens in key state preprocessing phase - i.e., works prior to activation of the key's action, including all macros. Postponing mechanism registers and postpones both key presses and releases, but does not preserve delays between them. Postponing affects even macro keystate queries, unless the macro in question is the one which initiates the postponing state (otherwise `postponeKeys delayUntilRelease` would indefinitely postpone its own release). Replay of postponed keys happens every `CYCLES_PER_ACTIVATION` update cycles, currently 2. The following commands either use this feature or allow control of the queue.

- `postponeKeys` modifier prefixed before another command keeps the firmware in postponing mode. Once no instance of postponeKeys modifer is active, the postponer will start replaying the keys. Replaying happens with normal event loop, which means that postponed keys will be replayed even during macro execution (most likely after next macro action). Some commands (thos from this section) apply this modifier implicitly. See MODIFIER section.
- `postponeNext <n>` command will apply `postponeKeys` modifier on the current command and following next n commands (macro actions).
- `ifPending/ifNotPending <n>` is true if there is at least `n` postponed keys in the queue.
- `ifPendingKeyReleased/ifNotPendingKeyReleased <queue idx>` is true if the key pending at `idx` in queue has been released. I.e., if there exists matching release event in the queue.
- `ifKeyPendingAt/ifNotKeyPendingAt <idx> <keyId>` looks into postponing queue at `idx`th waiting key and compares it to the `keyId`.
- `consumePending <n>` will remove n records from the queue.
- `activateKeyPostponed KEYID` will add tap of KEYID at the end of queue. If `atLayer LAYERID` is specified, action will be taken from that layer rather than current one. If `prepend` option is specified, event will be place at the beginning of the queue.
- `ifPrimary/ifSecondary [ simpleStrategy | advancedStrategy ] ... COMMAND` will wait until the firmware can distinguish whether primary or secondary action should be activated and then either execute `COMMAND` or skip it.
- `ifHold/ifTap COMMAND` will wait until the key that activated the macro will be released or until holdTimeout elapses. Then it will either execute the command or skip it.
- `ifShortcut/ifNotShortcut/ifGesture/ifNotGesture [IFSHORTCUT_OPTIONS]* [KEYID]*` will wait for next keypresses until sufficient number of keys has been pressed. If the next keypresses correspond to the provided arguments (hardware ids), the keypresses are consumed and the condition is performed. Consuming takes place in both `if` and `ifNot` versions if the full list is matched. E.g., `ifShortcut 090 089 final tapKey C-V; holdKey v`.
  - `Shortcut` requires continual press of keys (e.g., Ctrl+c). By default, it timeouts with the activation key release.
  - `Gesture` allows a noncontinual sequence of keys (e.g., vim's gg). By default, timeouts in 1000 ms since activation.
  - `IFSHORTCUT_OPTIONS`:
    - `noConsume` allows not consuming the keys. Useful if the next action is a standalone action, yet we want to branch the behaviour of the current macro depending on it.
    - `transitive` makes termination conditions relate to that key of the queue whose result is most permissive (normally, they always refer to the activation key) - e.g., in transitive mode with a 3-key shortcut, the first key can be released once the second key is being held. Timers count the time since the last performed action in this mode. Both `timeoutIn` and `cancelIn` behave according to this flag. In non-transitive mode, timers are counted since the activation key press - i.e., since the macro start.
    - `anyOrder` will check only presence of mentioned keyIds in postponer queue.
    - `orGate` will treat the given list of keys as *or-conditions* (rather than as *and-conditions*). Check any presence of mentioned keyIds in postponer queue for the next key press. Implies `anyOrder`.
    - `timeoutIn <time (INT)>` adds a timeout timer to both `Shortcut` and `Gesture` commands. If the timer times out (i.e., the condition does not suceed or fail earlier), the command continues as if matching KEYIDs failed. Can be used to shorten life of `Shortcut` resolution.
    - `cancelIn <time (INT)>` adds a timer to both commands. If this timer times out, all related keys are consumed and macro is broken. *"This action has never happened, lets not talk about it anymore."* (Note that this is an only condition which behaves same in both `if` and `ifNot` cases.)
- `resolveNextKeyId` will wait for next key press. When the next key is pressed, it will type a unique identifier identifying the pressed hardware key.
  - E.g., create a macro containing this command, and bind it to key `a`. Focus text editor. Tap `a`, tap `b`. Now, you should see `91` in your text editor, which is `b`'s `KEYID`.

### Conditions

Conditions are checked before processing the rest of the command. If the condition does not hold, the rest of the command is skipped entirely. If the command is evaluated multiple times (i.e., if it internally consists of multiple steps, such as the delay, which is evaluated repeatedly until the desired time has passed), the condition is evaluated only in the first iteration.

- `if BOOL` allows switching based on a custom expression. E.g., `if ($keystrokeDelay > 10) ...`
- `else` condition is true if the previous command ended due to a failed condition.
- `ifDoubletap/ifNotDoubletap` is true if the macro was started at most 300ms after the start of another instance of the same macro.
- `ifInterrupted/ifNotInterrupted` is true if a keystroke action or mouse action was triggered during macro runtime. Allows fake implementation of secondary roles. Also allows interruption of cycles.
- `ifReleased/ifNotReleased` is true if the key which activated current macro has been released. If the key has been physically released but the release has been postponed by another key, the conditien yields false. If the key has been physically released and the postponing mode was initiated by this macro (e.g., `postponeKeys ifReleased goTo ($currentAddress+2)`), it returns non-postponed release state (i.e., true if there's a matching release event in the postponing queue).
- `ifPending/ifNotPending <n>` is true if there is at least `n` postponed keys in the postponing queue. In context of postponing mechanism, this condition acts similar in place of ifInterrupted.
- `ifPendingKeyReleased/ifNotPendingKeyReleased <queue idx>` is true if the key pending at `idx` in queue has been released. I.e., if there exists matching release event in the queue.
- `ifKeyPendingAt/ifNotKeyPendingAt <idx> KEYID` looks into the postponing queue at `idx`th waiting key press and compares it to the `keyId`. See `resolveNextKeyId`.
- `ifKeyActive/ifNotKeyActive KEYID` is true if the key is pressed at the moment. This considers *postponed* states (I.e., reads state as processed by postponer, not reading actual hardware states).
- `ifKeyDefined/ifNotKeyDefined KEYID` is true if the key in parameter has defined action on the current keymap && layer. If you wish to test keys from different layers/keymaps, you will have to toggle them manually first.
- `ifPlaytime/ifNotPlaytime <timeout in ms>` is true if at least `timeout` milliseconds passed since macro was started.
- `ifShift/ifAlt/ifCtrl/ifGui/ifAnyMod/ifNotShift/ifNotAlt/ifNotCtrl/ifNotGui/ifNotAnyMod` is true if either right or left modifier was held in the previous update cycle. This does not indicate modifiers which were triggered from macroes.
- `ifCapsLockOn/ifNotCapsLockOn/ifScrollLockOn/ifNotScrollLockOn/ifNumLockOn/ifNotNumLockOn` is true if corresponding caps lock / num lock / scroll lock is set to true by the host OS.
  - Please note that:
      - under Linux, scroll lock is disabled by default. As a consequence, the macro event does not trigger.
      - under MacOS, scroll lock dims the screen but does not toggle the scroll lock state. As a consequence, the macro event does not trigger.
- `{ifKeymap|ifNotKeymap|ifLayer|ifNotLayer} <value>` will test if the current Keymap/Layer equals the first argument.
- `{ifLayerToggled|ifNotLayerToggled}` will return true if current layer is toggled. It will return true if the toggled layer is on top of the stack, or anywhere else as long as only the same (currently active) layers are above it in the layer stack.
- `ifRecording/ifNotRecording` and `ifRecordingId/ifNotRecordingId MACROID` test if the runtime macro recorder is in the recording state.
- `ifShortcut/ifNotShortcut [IFSHORTCUT_OPTIONS]* [KEYID]*` will wait for future keypresses and compare them to the argument. See the postponer mechanism section.
- `ifGesture/ifNotGesture [IFSHORTCUT_OPTIONS]* [KEYID]*` just as `ifShortcut`, but breaks after 1000ms instead of when the key is released. See the postponer mechanism section.
- `ifPrimary/ifSecondary [ simpleStrategy | advancedStrategy ] ... COMMAND` will wait until the firmware can distinguish whether primary or secondary action should be activated and then either execute `COMMAND` or skip it.

### Modifiers

Modifiers modify behaviour of the rest of the keyboard while the rest of the command is active (e.g., a delay) is active.

- `suppressMods` will supress any modifiers except those applied via macro engine. Can be used to remap shift and nonShift characters independently.
- `postponeKeys` will postpone all new key activations for as long as any instance of this modifier is active. See postponing mechanisms section.
- `final` will end macro playback after the "modified" action is properly finished. Simplifies control flow. "Implicit break."
- `autoRepeat` will continuously repeats the following command while holding the macro key, with some configurable delay. See `set autoRepeatDelay <time>` and `set autoRepeatRate <time>` for more details. This enables you to use keyrepeat feature (which is typically implemented in the OS level) with any macro action. For example, you can use something like `autoRepeat tapKey down` or `ifShift autoRepeat tapKeySeq C-right right`.
- `oneShot` prolongs this key's press until another action takes place or oneShot times out. E.g., `oneShot holdLayer mod`. Set timeout by `set oneShotTimeout 500`.

### Runtime macros:

Macro recorder targets vim-like macro functionality.

Usage (e.g.): call `recordMacro a`, do some work, end recording by another `recordMacro a`. Now you can play the actions (i.e., sequence of keyboard reports) back by calling `playMacro a`.

Only BasicKeyboard scancodes are available at the moment. These macros are recorded into RAM only. Number of macros is limited by memory (current limit is set to approximately 500 keystrokes (4kb) (maximum is ~1000 if we used all available memory)). If less than 1/4 of dedicated memory is free, oldest macro slot is freed. If currently recorded macro is longer than 1/4 of dedicated memory, recording is stopped and the macro is freed (prevents unwanted deletion of macros).

Macro slots are identified by a single character or a number or `$thisKeyId` (meaning "this key").

- `recordMacroDelay` will measure the time until key release (i.e., works like `delayUntilRelease`) and insert a delay of that length into the currently recorded macro. This can be used to wait for a window manager's reaction etc.
- `recordMacro [<macro slot id(MACROID)>]` will toggle recording (i.e., either start or stop)
- `startRecording [<macro slot id(MACROID)>]` will stop current recording (if any) and start new
- `stopRecording` will stop recording the current macro
- If the `MACROID` argument is omitted, the last used id is used.
- `{startRecordingBlind | stopRecordingBlind | recordMacroBlind} ...` work similarly, except that the basic scancode output of the keyboard is suppressed.

### Named variables:

`setVar <name> <value>` allows setting/creating custom named variable. E.g., `setVar foo ($abc + 3)`. Value then can be accessed via `$foo` in place of numeric argument.

Internally, values are saved in one of the following types, and types are automatically converted as needed in expressions:
- `INT` - as a int32_t. E.g., `(7/3)` yields 2
- `FLOAT` - as 32-bit floating point value. E.g., `(7/3.0)` yields 2.333...
- `BOOL` - 1 or 0 value

### Configuration options:

- `set stickyModifiers {never|smart|always}` globally turns on or off sticky modifiers. This affects only standard scancode actions. Macro actions (both gui and command ones) are always nonsticky, unless `sticky` flag is included in `tapKey|holdKey|pressKey` commands. Default value is `smart`, which is the official behaviour - i.e., `<alt/ctrl/gui> + <tab/arrows>` are sticky.
- `set diagonalSpeedCompensation BOOL` will divide diagonal mouse speed by sqrt(2) if enabled.
- `set chordingDelay 0 | <time in ms (INT)>` If nonzero, keyboard will delay *all* key actions by the specified time (recommended 50ms). If another key is pressed during this time, pending key actions will be sorted according to their type:
  1) Keymap/layer switches
  2) Macros
  3) Keystrokes and mouse actions
  This allows the user to trigger chorded shortcuts in an arbitrary order (all at the "same" time). E.g., if `A+Ctrl` is pressed instead of `Ctrl+A`, the keyboard will still send `Ctrl+A` if the two key presses follow within the specified time.
- `set autoShiftDelay 0 | <time in ms (INT)>` If nonzero, the autoshift feature is turned on. This adds shift to a scancode when the key is held for at least `autoShiftDelay` ms. (E.g., tapping 'a' results in 'a', pressing 'a' for a little bit longer results in 'A'.)
- `set debounceDelay <time in ms, at most 250>` prevents key state from changing for some time after every state change. This is needed because contacts of mechanical switches can bounce after contact and therefore change state multiple times in span of a few milliseconds. Official firmware debounce time is 50 ms for both press and release. Recommended value is 10-50, default is 50.
- `set doubletapTimeout <time in ms, at most 65535>` controls doubletap timeouts for both layer switchers and for the `ifDoubletap` condition.
- `set keystrokeDelay <time in ms, at most 65535>` allows slowing down keyboard output. This is handy for lousily written RDP clients and other software which just scans keys once a while and processes them in wrong order if multiple keys have been pressed inbetween. In more detail, this setting adds a delay whenever a basic usb report is sent. During this delay, key matrix is still scanned and keys are debounced, but instead of activating, the keys are added into a queue to be replayed later. Recommended value is 10 if you have issues with RDP missing modifier keys, 0 otherwise.
- `set autoRepeatDelay <time in ms, at most 65535>` and `set autoRepeatRate <time in ms, at most 65535>` allows you to set the initial delay (default: 500 ms) and the repeat delay (default: 50 ms) when using `autoRepeat`. When you run the command `autoRepeat <command>`, the `<command>` is first run without delay. Then, it will waits `autoRepeatDelay` amount of time before running `<command>` again. Then and thereafter, it will waits `autoRepeatRate` amount of time before repeating `<command>` again. This is consistent with typical OS keyrepeat feature.
- `set oneShotTimeout <time in ms, at most 65535>` sets the timeout for `oneShot` modifier. Zero means infinite.
- `set mouseKeys.{move|scroll}.{...} INT` please refer to Agent for more details.
  - `initialSpeed` - the speed that is active when the key is pressed.
  - `initialAcceleration,baseSpeed` - when the mouse key is held, speed increases until it reaches baseSpeed.
  - `deceleratedSpeed` - speed as affected by deceleration modifier.
  - `acceleratedSpeed` - speed as affected by acceleration modifier.
  - `axisSkew` - axis skew multiplies the horizontal axis and divides the vertical axis. The default value is 1.0, a reasonable value is between 0.5-2.0 Useful for very niche use cases.
- `set module.MODULEID.{baseSpeed|speed|xceleration}` modifies speed characteristics of right side modules.

    Simply speaking, `xceleration` increases sensitivity at high speeds, while decreasing sensitivity at low speeds. Furthermore, `speed` controls contribution of the acceleration formula. The `baseSpeed` can be used to offset the low-speed-sensitivity-decrease effect by making some raw input be applied directlo to the output.

    ![speed relations](resources/mouse_speeds.svg)

    Actual formula is is something like `speedMultiplier(normalizedSpeed) = baseSpeed + speed*(normalizedSpeed^xceleration)` where `normalizedSpeed = actualSpeed / midSpeed`. Therefore `appliedDistance(distance d, time t) = d*(baseSpeed*((d/t)/midSpeed) + d*speed*(((d/t)/midSpeed)^xceleration))`. (`d/t` is actual speed in px/s, `(d/t)/midSpeed` is normalizedSpeed which acts as base for the exponent).
  - `baseSpeed` makes a portion of the raw input contribute directly to the output. I.e., if `speed = 0`, then the traveled distance is `reportedDistance*baseSpeed`.
  - `speed` multiplies the effect of the xceleration expression. I.e., simply multiplies the reported distance when the actual speed equals `midSpeed`.
  - `xceleration` is exponent applied to the speed normalized w.r.t midSpeed. It makes cursor move relatively slower at low speeds and faster with aggresive swipes. It increases non-linearity of the curve, yet does not alone make the cursor faster and more responsive - thence "xceleration" rather than "acceleration" to avoid confusion. I.e., xceleration expression of the formula is `speed*(reportedSpeed/midSpeed)^(xceleration)`. I.e., no acceleration is xceleration = 0, reasonable (square root) acceleration is xceleration = 0.5. Highest recommended value is 1.0.
  - `midSpeed` represents "middle" speed, where the user can easily imagine behaviour of the device (currently fixed 3000 px/s) and henceforth easily set the coefficient. At this speed, acceleration formula yields `1.0`, i.e., `speedModifier = (baseSpeed + speed)`.

  General guidelines are:
    - If your cursor is sluggish at low speeds, you want to:
      - either lower xceleration
      - or increase baseSpeed
    - If you struggle to cover large distances with a single swipe, you want to:
      - set xceleration to either `0.5` or `1.0` (or somewhere in-between)
      - and then increase speed till you are satisfied
    - If the cursor moves non-intuitively:
      - you want to either lower xceleration (`0.5` is a reasonable value)
      - or increase baseSpeed
    - If you want to make the cursor more responsive overall:
      - you want to increase speed

  (Mostly) reasonable examples (`baseSpeed speed xceleration midSpeed`):
    - `0.0 1.0 0.0 3000` (no xceleration)
      - speed multiplier is always 1x at all speeds
    - `0.0 1.0 0.5 3000` (square root multiplier)
      - starts at 0x speed multiplier - allowing for very precise movement at low speed)
      - at 3000 px/s, yields cursor speed equal to the actual picked-up movement
      - at 12000 px/s, cursor speed is going to be twice the movement (because `sqrt(4) = 2`)
    - `0.5 0.5 1.0 3000` (linear speedup starting at 0.5)
      - starts at 0.5x speed multiplier - meaning that the resulting cursor speed is half the picked-up movement at low speeds
      - at 3000 px/s, speed multiplier is 1x
      - at 12000 px/s, speed multiplier is 2.5x
      - (notice that linear xceleration actually means quadratic overall curve)
    - `1.0 1.0 1.0 3000`
      - the same as before, but the resulting cursor speed is double. I.e., 1x at 0 speed, 2x at 3000 px/s, 5x at 12000 px/s
    - `0.0 1.0 1.0 3000` (linear speedup starting at 0)
      - again very precise at low speed
      - at 3000 px/s, speed multiplier is 1x
      - at 6000 px/s, speed multiplier is 4x
      - not recommended - the curve will behave in a very non-linear fashion.
- `set module.MODULEID.{caretSpeedDivisor|scrollSpeedDivisor|zoomSpeedDivisor|swapAxes|invertScrollDirection|invertScrollDirectionX|invertScrollDirectionY}` modifies scrolling and caret behaviour:
    - `caretSpeedDivisor` (default: 16) is used to divide input in caret mode. This means that per one tick, you have to move by 16 pixels (or whatever the unit is). (This is further modified by axisLocking skew, as well as by acceleration.)
    - `scrollSpeedDivisor` (default: 8) is used to divide input in scroll mode. This means that while scrolling, every 8 pixels produce one scroll tick. (This is further modified by axisLocking skew, as well as acceleration.)
    - `pinchZoomDivisor` (default: 4 (?)) is used specifically for the touchpad's zoom gesture, therefore its default value is nonstandard. Only valid for touchpad.
    - `swapAxes` swaps the x and y coordinates of the module. The intended use is for the keycluster trackball, since sideways scrolling is easier.
    - `invertScrollDirection` inverts the scroll direction in the y-axis...
    - `invertScrollDirectionX` explicitly inverts the scroll direction in the x-axis...
    - `invertScrollDirectionY` explicitly inverts the scroll direction in the y-axis...

- `set module.MODULEID.{axisLockSkew|axisLockFirstTickSkew|cursorAxisLock|scrollAxisLock}` control axis locking feature:

  When you first move in navigation mode that has axis locking enabled, the axis is locked to one of the axes. Axis-locking behaviour is defined by two characteristics:

  - axis skew: when axis is locked, the secondary axis value is multiplied by `axisLockSkew`. This means that in order to change locked direction (with 0.5 value), you have to produce stroke that goes at least twice as fast in the non-locked direction compared to the locked one.
  - secondary axis zeroing: whenever the locked (primary) axis produces an event, the secondary axis is zeroed.

  Behaviour of the first tick (the one which locks the axis) can be controlled independently. The first tick (the first event produced when the axis is not yet locked) skew is applied to *both* axes. This allows the following tweaks:

  - use `axisLockFirstTickSkew = 0.5` in order to require a stronger "push" at the beginning of a movement. Useful for the mini trackball, since it is likely to produce an unwanted move event when you try to just click it. With a `0.5` value, it will require two roll events to activate.
  - use `axisLockFirstTickSkew = 2.0` in order to make the first event more responsive. E.g., caret mode will make the fist character move even with a very gently push, while consecutive activations will need greater momentum.

  By default, axis locking is enabled in scroll and discreet modes for right hand modules, and for scroll, caret and media modes for keycluster.

  - `axisLockSkew` controls caret axis locking. Defaults to 0.5, valid/reasonable values are 0-100, centered around 1.
  - `axisLockFirstTickSkew` - same meaning as `axisLockSkew`, but controls how axis locking applies on the first tick.
 non-zero value means that the first tick will require a "push" before the cursor starts moving. Or will require less "force" if the value is greater than 1.
  - `cursorAxisLock BOOL` - turns axis locking on for cursor mode. Not recommended, but possible.
  - `scrollAxisLock BOOL` - turns axis locking on for scroll mode. Default for keycluster trackball.
  - `caretAxisLock BOOL` - turns axis locking on for all discrete modes.

- `set module.touchpad.holdContinuationTimeout <0-65535 (INT)>` If non-zero, touchpad allows you to release your finger for the specified amount of time during drag-and-drop (without the left click getting released).

- Remapping keys:
  - `set navigationModeAction.{caret|media}.{DIRECTION|none} ACTION` can be used to customize the caret or media mode behaviour by binding directions to macros. This action is global and reversible only by powercycling.
  - `set keymapAction.LAYERID.KEYID ACTION` can be used to remap any action that lives in a keymap. Most remappable ids can be retrieved with `resolveNextKeyId`. Keyid can also be constructed manually - see `KEYID`. Binding applies only until the next keymap switch. E.g., `set keymapAction.base.64 keystroke escape` (maps `~` key to escape), or `set keymapAction.fn.193 macro TouchpadAction` (maps touchpad two-finger gesture to a macro named `TouchpadAction`).

- Secondary roles section configures the resolution strategy used for controlling both the native (agent-mapped) secondary roles and the`ifPrimary` and `ifSecondary` conditions.

  - `set secondaryRole.defaultStrategy [ simple | advanced ]` sets the default resolution strategy to be used. Furthermore, `ifPrimary/ifSecondary` can specify explicitly which strategy to use (e.g., `ifPrimary advancedStrategy final tapKey a`).
    - simple strategy listens for other key activations until the dual-role key is released. If there is any such activation, it activates the secondary role and then the action of the other key without any further delays. If there is no such other action, it performs primary role on the dual-role key release.
    - advanced strategy may trigger secondary role depending on timeout, or depending on key release order.
      - `set secondaryRole.advanced.timeout <timeout in ms, 350 (INT)>` if this timeout is reached, `timeoutAction` (secondary by default) role is activated.
      - `set secondaryRole.advanced.timeoutAction { primary | secondary }` defines whether the primary action or the secondary role should be activated when timeout is reached
      - `set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByRelease BOOL` if enabled, secondary role is chosen depending on the release order of the keys (`press-A, press-B, release-B, release-A` leads to secondary action; `press-A, press-B, release-A, release-B` leads to primary action). This is further modified by safetyMargin.
      - `set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByPress BOOL` if enabled, secondary role is triggered when there is another press, simiarly to the simple strategy. Unlike simple strategy, this allows setting timeout behaviors, and also is modified by safetyMargin.
      - `set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByMouse BOOL` if enabled, any mouse (module) activity triggers secondary role immediately.
      - `set secondaryRole.advanced.safetyMargin <ms, -50 - 50 (INT)>` finetunes sensitivity of the trigger-by-release and trigger-by-press behaviours, so that positive values favor primary role, while negative values favor secondary role. This works by adding the value to the action key (or subtracting from the dual role key). E.g., suppose trigger by release is active, and safetyMargin equal 50. Furthermore assume that dual-role key is released 30ms after the action key. Due to safety margin 50 being greater than 30, the dual-role key is still considered to be released first, and so primary role is activated.
      - `set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapToPrimary BOOL` allows initiating hold of primary action by doubletap. (Useful if you want a dual key on space.)
      - `set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapTime <ms, 200 (INT)>` configures the above timeout (measured press-to-press).

- `macroEngine`
  - terminology:
       - action - one action as shown in the agent.
       - subAction - some actions have multiple phases (such as tapKey which consists at least of press and release, or delay). Such actions may take multiple update cycles to complete.
       - command - in case of command action, the action consists of multiple commands. A command is defined as any nonempty text line. Commands are treated as actions, which means that the macro action context is resetted for every command line. Every command line has its own address.
  - `scheduler` controls how are macros executed.
    - `preemptive` default old one - freely interleaves commands. It gives every macro slot an oppotunity to execute one action or subaction or command. This means that no macro can block operation of ther macros, but comes at a cost of quirkiness and nondeterminism.
      - `batchSize` limits how many commands can be executed per one macro slot per macro engine invocation.
    - `blocking` experimental scheduler. This scheduler keeps track of macro states and allows only one macro to run at a time. If a macro yields (either enters waiting state or explicitly yields), another macro gets the exclusive privilege of running. As long as there are running (nonsleeping / waiting) macros, the rest of the keyboard is in the postponing state.
      - `batchSize` parameter controls how many commands can be executed per one macro engine invocation. If the number is exceeded, normal update cycle resumes in the postponing state. This means that if a macro takes many actions, keyboard keys get queued in a queue to be executed later in the correct order.
      - Macro states roughly correspond to the following:
        - In progress - means that current action progresses state of the macro - i.e., does some work. As long as macro actions/subactions/commands return this state, they can be all executed within one keyboard update cycle.
        - In progress blocking - corresponds to commands that operate on usb reports - e.g., tap keys, etc.. If a macro returns with this state, the macro engine allows the keyboard to complete the update cycle in order to send the usb reports. This update cycle is performed in postponing mode. The macro engine is then resumed at the same action.
        - In progress waiting - corresponds to waiting states, such as `delayUntil`, `ifGesture`, `ifSecondary`. Whenever they get the running privilege, they check their state and yield, allowing the rest of the keyboard to run uninterrupted. These don't initiate postponing unless it is part of their function.
        - Sleeping - if one macro calls another, the caller sleeps until the callee finishes.
        - Backward jump - any backward jump also yields. This should prevent unwanted endless loops, as well as the need for the user to manage yielding logic manually.

- backlight:
    - `backlight.strategy { functional | constantRgb | perKeyRgb }` sets backlight strategy.
    - `backlight.constantRgb.rgb INT INT INT` allows setting custom constant colour for the entire keyboard. E.g.: `set backlight.strategy constantRgb; set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 255 0 0` to make entire keyboard shine red.
    - `backlight.keyRgb.LAYERID.KEYID INT INT INT` allows overriding color of the key. This override will last until reload of keymap and will apply to all backlight strategies.

- general led configuration:
    - `leds.enabled BOOL` turns on/off all keyboard leds: i.e., backlight, indicator leds, segment display
    - `leds.brightness <0-1 multiple of default (FLOAT)>` allows scaling default brightness. E.g., `0.5` will dim the entire keyboard to half of the default values that are configured in Agent
    - `leds.fadeTimeout <seconds to fade after (INT)>` will make uhk turn off all leds after the configured interval. (This is an alias that sets all of `{keyBacklightFadeTimeout|keyBacklightFadeBatteryTimeout|displayFadeTimeout|displayFadeBatteryTimeout}`)

- modifier layer triggers:
    - `set modifierLayerTriggers.{shift|alt|super|ctrl} {left|right|both}` controls whether modifier layers are triggered by left or right or either of the modifiers.

### Argument parsing rules:

- `INT` is parsed as a 32 bit signed integer and then assigned into the target variable. However, the target variable is often only 8 or 16 bit unsigned.
- `EXPRESSION` / variables - all numeric/boolean arguments also accept arbitrary expressions. These have to be enclosed in parentheses.
  - The following operators are accepted:
    - `+,-,*,/,%` - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo
    - `min(),max()` - minimum, maximum, e.g. `min($a, 2, 3, 4)`
    - `<,<=,>,>=` - less than, less or equal, greater than, greater or equal
    - `==,!=` - equals, not equals
    - `!` - unary boolean negation
    - `&&`, `||` - and, or
  - The following special identifiers are supported:
    - `$thisKeyId` which stands for the keyid of the key that activated the macro.
    - `$keyId.<keyId abbreviation>` which stands for numeric keyid of the provided abbreviation.
    - `$currentAddress` which stands for the address of the command in which it is found.
    - `$queuedKeyId.<index (NUMBER)>` which stands for a zero-indexed position in the postponer queue.
- `KEYMAPID` - is assumed to be 3 characters long abbreviation of a keymap.
- `MACROID` - macro slot identifier is either a number or a single ascii character (interpreted as a one-byte value). `$thisKeyId` can be used so that the same macro refers to different slots when assigned to different keys.
- `custom text` is an arbitrary text starting on the next non-space character and ending at the end of the text action. (Yes, this should be refactored in the future.)
- `KEYID` is a numeric id obtained by `resolveNextKeyId` macro. It can also be constructed manually, as an index (starting at zero) added to an offset of `64*slotid`.  This means that starting offsets are:

```
  RightKeyboardHalf = 0
  LeftKeyboardHalf  = 64
  LeftModule        = 128
  RightModule       = 192
```

- `SHORTCUT` is an abbreviation of a key possibly accompanied by modifiers. Describes at most one scancode action. Can be prefixed by `C/S/A/G` denoting `Control/Shift/Alt/Gui`. Mods can further be prefixed by `L/R`, denoting left or right modifier. If a single ascii character is entered, it is translated into corresponding key combination (shift mask + scancode) according to standard EN-US layout. E.g., `pressKey mouseBtnLeft`, `tapKey LC-v` (Left Control + (lowercase) V (scancode)), `tapKey CS-f5` (Ctrl + Shift + F5), `tapKey v` (V), `tapKey V` (Shift + V).
- `LABEL` is an identifier marking some lines of the macro. When a string is encountered in a context of an address, UHK looks for a command beginning by `<the string>:` and returns its addres (index). If the same label is present multiple times, the next one w.r.t. currently processed command is returned.
- `ADDRESS` addresses allow jumping between macro instructions. Every action or command has its own address, numbered from zero. Formally, address is either a `INT` or a string which denotes label identifier. Every action consumes at least one address. (Except for command action, exactly one.) Every command (non-empty line of command action) consumes one address. E.g., `goTo 0` (go to beginning), `goTo ($currentAddress-1)` (go to the previous command), `goTo $currentAddress` (active waiting), `goTo default` (go to a line which begins by `default: ...`).

### Navigation modes:

UHK modules feature four navigation modes, which are mapped by layer and module. This mapping can be changed by the `set module.MODULEID.navigationMode.LAYERID_BASIC NAVIGATION_MODE` command.

- **Cursor mode** - in this mode, modules control mouse movement. Default mode for all modules except keycluster's trackball.
- **Scroll mode** - in this mode, the module can be used to scroll. Default mode for mod layer. This means that apart from layer switching, your layer switch key also makes your right-hand module act as a comfortable scroll wheel. Sensitivity is controlled by the `scrollSpeedDivisor` value.
- **Caret mode** - in this mode, module produces arrow key taps. This can be used to move comfortably in a text editor, since in this mode, the cursor is also locked to one of the two directions, preventing unwanted line changes. Sensitivity is controlled by `caretSpeedDivisor`, `axisLockStrengthFirstTick`, and `axisLockStrength`.
- **Media mode** - in this mode, up/down directions control volume (via media key scancodes), while horizontal play/pause and switch to the next track. At the moment, this mode is not enabled by default on any layer. Sensitivity is shared with the caret mode.
- **Zoom mode pc / mac** - in this mode, `Ctrl +`/`Ctrl -` or `Gui +`/`Gui -` shortcuts are produced.
- **Zoom mode** - This mode serves specifically to implement the touchpad pinch zoom gesture. It alternates actions of zoomPc and zoomMac modes. Can be customized via `set module.touchpad.pinchZoomMode NAVIGATION_MODE`.

Caret and media modes can be customized by `set navigationModeAction` command.

### bluetooth connectiviy rules:

Dongle colors:
- red means the dongle is either not paired to any device, or not actively trying to connect.
- violet means the dongle is paired to some UHK and is actively trying to establish a connection.
- blue means a dongle is connected to some uhk, but is not its usb report target. These are dongles that are prepared for action and can be immediately switched to via `switchHost` command.
- green is the currently active dongle.

Connection counts:
- Uhk can handle up to 3 peripheral connections at a time, including 3 simultaneously connected dongles. Peripheral connection can be a ble hid connection (for instance a smartphone), a dongle connection, or ble advertising.
- Uhk handles at most one BLE HID at a time.

Rules:
- Uhk will iterate over connected devices (blue dongles, usb, ble hid) by `switchHost {previous | next | last}`. This switchover is almost instantaneous, but can reach only currently connected devices.
- Uhk can connect to violet dongles or additional ble hids by calling `switchHost <host connection name(STRING)>`. In that case, it reserves one connection slot for the selected device. This may mean disconnecting some of the currently connected devices. This kind of switchover usually takes a second or so, but can reach all devices.


### Modifier layers:

Modifier layers are meant to allow easy overriding of modifier scancodes. If you bind an action there, it will be activated from the base layer when the corresponding modifier is pressed. E.g., allowing different scancodes for shifted keys compared to non-shifted keys. As such, they are not really layers.

These layers work through an elaborate setup of positive and negative sticky layer masks.
