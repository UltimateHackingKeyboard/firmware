# Extended macro engine

The extended macro engine originates in kareltucek/firmware and is fully merged and enabled by default in stock firmware. Some of the commands are featured officially in Agent's side pane reference, some are not. The latter group is provided without guarantees and may be removed or reshaped in the future.

The engine implements:
- macro commands for most features of the keyboard
- conditionals, jumps, and sync mechanisms
- runtime macro recorder implemented on scancode level, for vim-like macro functionality
- many configuration options
- ability to run multiple macros at the same time

Some of the use cases which can be achieved via these commands are:
- mimicking secondary roles
- binding actions to doubletaps
- binding arbitrary shortcuts or gestures
- binding shift and non-shift scancodes independently
- configuring custom layer switching logic, including nested layer toggling
- unlimited number of layers via referencing layers of different keymaps

## Getting started

0.1) Get your UHK :-). https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/

0.2) Unless you specifically wish to use the extended command set, you may wish to start with officially supported macros. In that case, please see the smart macro reference included in the right-side pane of Agent. Its quality is far superior to this document and features various interactive widgets that allow you to construct macros by just clicking and sliding GUI elements.

1) Create some macro with some command action. (And bind it in your keymap.) For instance:

```
holdKey iLS
ifDoubletap tapKey capsLock
```

![Doubletap to caps-lock macro](resources/caps_macro.png)

2) Understand how this guide and the reference manual work:

    - Use Ctrl+F (or equivalent) a lot - here, and in the [reference manual](reference-manual.md).
    - Go through the sections of the reference manual - just reading the top section lines will give you some idea about available types of commands.
    - Read through examples in order to understand how the constructs can be combined.
    - Understand how to read the stated ebnf grammar. The grammar gives you precise instructions about available features and their parameters, as well as correct syntax. Note that some commands and parameters are only mentioned in the grammar! In case you don't know anything about grammars:
        - The grammar describes a valid expression via a set of rules. In the beginning, the expression equals "BODY". Every capital word of the expression is to be "rewritten" by (some instance of) a corresponding rule.
        - Notation: `<>` mark informal (human-understandable) explanation of what is to be entered. The `|` operator indicates a choice between left and right operands. It is typically enclosed in `{}`, in order to separate the group from the rest of the rule. `[]` denotes optional arguments. Especially `[]+` marks "one or more" and `[]*` arbitrary number.
            Operator | syntax
             --- | ---
            rules - need to be expanded | `UPPERCASE_IDENTIFIERS`
            obligatory group | `{ ... }`
            optional group | `[ ... ]`
            one or more | `[ ... ]+`
            any number | `[ ... ]*`
            choice | `A \| B`
            resolved text | `text`
            human-readable description | `<hint>`
            human-readable description, backed by a specific rule | `<hint (RULE)>`

        - Provided value bounds are informational only - they denote values that seem to make sense. Sometimes default values are marked.
    - If you are still not sure about some feature or syntax, do not hesitate to ask.

3) If `ERR` appears on the display, you can retrieve the description by using `printStatus` over a focused text editor. Or, using the above point, just search the [reference manual](reference-manual.md) for `ERR`.

4) If you encounter a bug, let me know. There are lots of features and quite few users around this codebase - if you do not report problems you find, chances are that no one else will (since most likely no one else has noticed).

## Known software limitations and oddities

- Karabiner Elements does weird things in combination with UHK.

  Fix: disable Karabiner elements.

- Mac ignores short caps-lock taps.

  Fix: add a manual delay of 400 ms or so.

- Games sample input instead of processing press and release events in order. As a result, actions of secondary role keys (e.g., esc on UHK mouse key), or any macro taps get ignored.

  Fix: add manual ~50 ms delays; program secondary roles via macros.

- Some software receives input in the wrong order when the input is too fast. E.g., shift+9 sometimes produces `(`, sometimes `9`.

  Fix: `set keystrokeDelay 10`.

- Shift in shift+click macro often gets ignored. (Encountered under Windows.) This is because mouse click and shift are communicated over different usb interfaces, and therefore tend to arrive in the wrong order.

  Fix: `set keystrokeDelay 10`. 

- RDP sessions ignore modifiers.

  Fix: `set keystrokeDelay 10`.

- Linux ignores mouse releases shorter than ~20ms, which is a trouble for touchpad's doubletap-to-drag gesture.

  UHK firmware fixes this by inserting artificial delays of 20ms.

- Some software gets confused by horizontal scrolling. (Encountered under Windows.)

  Fix: make sure your scrollAxisLock is enabled (`set module.MODULEID.scrollAxisLock 1`), maybe fine-tune its settings, and make sure you scroll along the vertical axis of the module in question.

## Macro events

Macro events are specially named macros that get executed on specific occasions. For instance macro named `$onInit` will be run when UHK starts. A Macro named `$onKeymapChange any` will be run whenever a keymap is switched.

Some macro events are:
- `$onInit`
- `$onKeymapChange {KEYMAPID|any}`
- `$onLayerChange {LAYERID|any}`
- `$onKeymapLayerChange KEYMAPID LAYERID`


### Sharing layers across Keymaps

This can be also used to share layers across keymaps. For instance, assume I want to construct a colemak keymap (COL) that shares non-base layers with my querty (QTY) keymap. Then I will put the following into a macro named `$onKeymapChange COL`:

```
replaceLayer fn QTY fn
replaceLayer mod QTY mod
replaceLayer mouse QTY mouse
```

## Examples

Every nonempty line is considered as one command. Empty line, or commented line too. Empty lines are skipped. Exception is an empty command action, which counts for one command. Even `{` and `}` are treated as commands, and have to be on separate lines.

### Configuration

Configuration of the keyboard can be modified globally or per-keymap by using [macro events](reference-manual.md). For instance, the following may be placed into a macro named `$onInit` in order to make it applied on UHK startup:

```
// accel driver
set module.trackball.baseSpeed 0.5
set module.trackball.speed 1.0
set module.trackball.xceleration 0.5

//navigation modes
set module.trackball.navigationMode.base cursor
set module.trackball.navigationMode.fn caret
set module.trackball.navigationMode.mod scroll
set module.trackball.navigationMode.mouse scroll

//axis locks
set module.trackball.scrollAxisLock 1
set module.trackball.cursorAxisLock 0

//backlight defaults
set backlight.strategy constantRgb
set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 255 192 32
set leds.fadeTimeout 1
```

To change the sensitivity of modules, use the following snippet in your `$onInit` macro (to always apply), in your `$onKeymapChange QWR` macro (to change sensitivity in the QWR keymap), or in a regular macro (to change sensitivity on demand).

In order to figure out the right values, please see the Agent macro reference, or search the reference manual.

```
set module.trackball.baseSpeed 0.5
set module.trackball.speed 1.0
set module.trackball.xceleration 0.5
```

This enables and disables compensation of diagonal speed depending on shift state.

```
ifShift set diagonalSpeedCompensation 1
ifNotShift set diagonalSpeedCompensation 0
```

### KeystrokeDelay and known timing issues.

Another common configuration is `keystrokeDelay`. By default, UHK just churns out scancodes as fast as it can, which is a problem for various features such as the write text action or write command, because some programs out there are not prepared to receive input that fast. The following setting will slow down UHK's output so that at most one usb report is sent every 10 milliseconds.

```
set keystrokeDelay 10
```

### Binding keys and basic principles


Key lifecycle consists of two important points:

- key press
- key release

Various combinations of lifecycles are abstracted into the following actions:

- `pressKey` - just activate the scancode
- `releaseKey` - just deactivate it
- `tapKey` - activate the scancode and then immediately release it
- `holdKey` - activate the scancode and hold it for as long as the key is physically held, then release it
- `delayUntilRelease` - will wait until the key that activated the macro is released

So if we wanted to replace a regular 'a' key with a macro, we would use:

```
holdKey a
```

Which is similar to:

```
pressKey a
delayUntilRelease
releaseKey a
```


If we just want to quickly produce the `a` scancode/character, we would use:

```
tapKey a
```

Which is similar to:
```
pressKey a
releaseKey a
```

Complex key sequences can be achieved using `tapKeySeq`. For instance, following emoji macro (uses linux  Ctrl+U notation) will produce a shrugging person.
```
tapKeySeq CS-u 1 f 9 3 7 space
```

With these commands, modifiers are encoded using `CSAG`, with optional `LR` for the left and right side. E.g., `LC-a` means `left control + a`.

Press/release/hold/tap can be specified by `phtr` part of the mask. E.g., `tapKeySeq p-a t-b t-c r-a` means tap `b c` while holding `a`.

In macros, we also may chain multiple actions and include various conditions.

For instance, shift which also toggles caps lock on doubletap:

```
holdKey iLS
ifDoubletap tapKey capsLock
```

Or with Mac (which requires prolonged press of caps lock):

```
holdKey iLS
ifNotDoubletap break
pressKey capsLock
delayUntil 400
releaseKey capsLock
```

_sidenote: `i` in `iLS` makes the shift behave as a regular native shift, which is needed to trigger `ifShift` conditions. For more info, search reference manual for "composition modes"._

Mapping shift/non-shift scancodes independently:

```
ifShift suppressMods write 4
ifNotShift write %
```

Some common conditions are:
- `ifDoubletap` - yields true if another instance of the same macro executed lately.
- `ifInterrupted` - yields true if another key was pressed during the execution of the macro.
- `ifPlaytime 100` - yields true if macro ran for at least 100 ms.
- `ifShift` - yields true if a regular shift key is being held. (See composition modes in the reference for more info on how to hack more complex setups)

Conditions always exist in pairs, e.g., `ifDoubletap` and `ifNotDoubletap`, `ifPlaytime` and `ifNotPlaytime` etc.

There is also a concept of modifiers, which can modify the keyboard's or command's behaviour while a command is running:

- `suppressMods` - suppresses all standard modifiers, so you can rebind a shift and nonShift independent (or on the contrary dependent!) on shift state.
- `final` - ends macro after the "modified" command. Basically a syntactic sugar.
- `postponeKeys` - in order to mess with our time machine.
- `autoRepeat` - if we need to autorepeat manually from the keyboard. For instance `autoRepeat progressHue`.
- `oneShot` prolongs this key's press until another action takes place. E.g., `oneShot holdLayer mod`.

### Handling layers

In case of layer handling, macro layer switching commands have slightly different semantics from the native layer switching commands, allowing for more fine-tuned control of the behavior such as nested layer holds or toggles.

The following macro will result in switching to QWR keymap.

```
switchKeymap QWR
```

Implementation of a standard double-tap-locking hold modifier in nested version could look like:

```
holdLayer fn
ifDoubletap toggleLayer fn
```

Once the layer is toggled, the target layer needs to contain another macro to allow return to the base layer. This macro also allows holding the previous (usually base) layer from a toggled layer.

```
holdLayer previous
ifDoubletap untoggleLayer
```

Smart toggle (if tapped, locks layer; if used with a key, acts as a simple secondary role):

```
holdLayer mouse
ifNotInterrupted toggleLayer mouse
```

You can refer to layers of different keymaps via a set of `keymapLayer` commands. Be careful though, these reload entire keymaps, so they may pose a performance penalty, and they also reset all your in-memory configurations:

```
holdKeymapLayer QWR base
```

### Time machine

The firmware implements a postponing queue which allows some commands to act as a time machine by querying _future_ keystrokes, and decide what to do depending on those. In practice, it means waiting until more input is entered, and then either consuming those keys and doing something special, or rewinding back a bit and performing all the actions as if nothing happened.

One concept that uses this feature is _shortcut and gesture_ conditions.

- By _shortcuts_ we understand combinations of concurrently pressed keys that stand for a specific meaning. E.g., `Ctrl+C` is a shortcut for copying text.
- By _gestures_ we mean sequences of key taps that stands for a specific meaning. Unlike with "shortcuts", continuity of press is not required. For instance Vim-like gg (tap g twice), gt (tap g then tap t) and gT (tap g then tap shift+t).

You can use `ifShortcut` when you want to map an action to a combination of keys. E.g, if I want z+x to produce Control+x, z+c to produce Control+c, z+v to produce Control+v, I will map following macro on the z key:

```
ifShortcut x final tapKey C-x
ifShortcut c final tapKey C-c
ifShortcut v final tapKey C-v
holdKey z
```

An `ifShortcut` macro needs to be placed on the first key of the shortcut, and refers to other keys by their hardware ids. These ids can be entered in numeric form obtained by `resolveNextKeyId` command (i.e., activating the command and pressing the key while having a text editor focused), or abbreviations may be used (as shown above). The `final` modifier breaks the command after the "modified" `tapKey` command finishes.

`ifGesture` can be used to bind actions to "loose gestures" that don't require all keys to be pressed at the same time. Example of Vim-like gt and gT tab switching:

```
// bind this on g
ifGesture t final tapKey C-pageUp               // tap g then tap t to switch tab right
ifGesture leftShift t final tapKey C-pageDown   // tap g then tap shift+t to switch tab left
holdKey g                                       // otherwise act as regular g key
```

We can also use these to implement an emoji macro which allows us to write emojis using simple abbreviations - here tap `thisMacro + s + h` (as shrug) to get shrugging person, or `thisMacro + s + w` to get a sweaty smile.

```
ifGesture 80 73 final tapKeySeq CS-u 1 f 6 0 5 space
ifGesture 80 21 final tapKeySeq CS-u 1 f 9 3 7 space
...
```

In order to bind some action to doubletap, you may use two strategies:

- simple `ifDoubletap` condition, which just checks whether another instance of the same macro was active lately. Double tapping this will result in sequence `ab`:

```
ifDoubletap final tapKey b
holdKey a
```

- time-machine `ifGesture` condition. Double tapping this will produce a slight delay and then output just `b`:

```
ifGesture $thisKeyId final tapKey b
holdKey a
```

Another concept that may or may not use our time machine is secondary roles, namely the advanced strategy.

### Keyids vs Scancodes

Please note the difference between key ids and scancodes. Both notations use human-readable abbreviations and are therefore easy to mix up.

- _key ids_ identify specific hardware keys. Human readable key id abbreviations are assigned to match the printed key labels according to the default en-US layout. If you wish to use numeric key ids, then be sure that the numbers have always at least two digits (e.g., `ifGesture 03 ...`).
- _scancode_ abbreviations describe scancodes as communicated to the PC, mapped according to en-US scancode mapping.

For instance, if you rebind your UHK to Dvorak, then the key identified by hardware id `s` will be mapped to the `o` scancode (i.e., will read `o` in Agent, or contain `holdKey o` macro command). That is, issuing `activateKeyPostponed s` will produce the same thing as `holdKey o`. (Of course, if you furthermore choose some non-standard language mapping in your OS, you may end up with yet another character produced on screen.)

### Secondary roles

Secondary role is a role that becomes active if another key is pressed with this key. It can be implemented in the following variants:

- Using `ifInterrupted` command.
- Using native secondary role driver (via `ifPrimary`/`ifSecondary` or GUI-mapping) with one of the following resolution strategies:
  - simple strategy
  - advanced strategy which uses our time machine

#### Simulating secondary roles without secondary roles

Secondary role can be implemented using the `ifNotInterrupted` condition  - such macro always triggers secondary role, and once the key is released it either triggers primary role or not.

For instance:

```
holdLayer mouse
ifNotInterrupted tapKey enter
```

Regular secondary role with prevention of accidental key taps: (Activates the secondary role immediately, but activates the primary role only if the key has been pressed for at least a certain amount of time. This could be used to emulate the [Space Cadet Shift feature](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_space_cadet).)

```
holdKey leftShift
ifInterrupted break
ifPlaytime 200 break
tapKey S-9
```

#### Native secondary role - simple strategy

Simple strategy can be activated by `ifSecondary simpleStrategy` or `ifPrimary simpleStrategy`, or from agent GUI.

It can be explicitly set by:

```
set secondaryRole.defaultStrategy simple
```

However, at the moment of writing this, it already is the default strategy, so even without the above command, it can be activated by:

```
ifSecondary final holdLayer mouse
tapKey escape
```

This strategy does the same as the `ifNotInterrupted` version, except it activates secondary role only after the other key is pressed. This strategy does not use any complicated postponing.

Pros: it is reliable.
Cons: it will activate during writing if you put it on an alphanumeric key.

#### Native secondary role - advanced strategy

Advanced strategy postpones all other keypresses until it can distinguish between primary and secondary role. This is handy for alphabetic keys, or if the secondary role is not a no-op. This strategy can be used via `ifPrimary advancedStrategy` and `ifSecondary advancedStrategy` conditions.

It can be made default by:
```
set secondaryRole.defaultStrategy advanced
```

Then it can be activated via GUI-mapped secondary role, or simply:

```
ifPrimary final holdKey a
holdLayer mouse
```

The advanced strategy has the disadvantage that its configuration depends on the user's typing style. Please see the reference manual for the meaning of all its configuration values. Two example configurations follow.

Release-order configuration:

```
set secondaryRole.defaultStrategy advanced
set secondaryRole.advanced.timeout 350
set secondaryRole.advanced.timeoutAction secondary
set secondaryRole.advanced.safetyMargin 50
set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByRelease 1
set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapToPrimary 0
```

The above configuration distinguishes roles based on the release order of the keys. I.e., `press-A, press-B, release-B, releaseA` leads to secondary action; `press-A, press-B, release-A, release-B` leads to primary action. This configuration does not mind if you release keys lazily during writing.

More conventional timeout-triggered configuration:

```
set secondaryRole.defaultStrategy advanced
set secondaryRole.advanced.timeout 200
set secondaryRole.advanced.timeoutAction secondary
set secondaryRole.advanced.safetyMargin 0
set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByRelease 0
set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapToPrimary 1
set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapTime 200
```

Simple strategy behavior, but via advanced strategy and with timeout on 500ms:

```
set secondaryRole.defaultStrategy advanced
set secondaryRole.advanced.timeout 500
set secondaryRole.advanced.timeoutAction secondary
set secondaryRole.advanced.safetyMargin 0
set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByRelease 0
set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByPress 1
set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapToPrimary 1
set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapTime 200
```

Full set of advanced strategy config values follows (for copy-paste convenience):

```
set secondaryRole.defaultStrategy advanced
set secondaryRole.advanced.timeout 500
set secondaryRole.advanced.timeoutAction secondary
set secondaryRole.advanced.safetyMargin 0
set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByRelease 0
set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByPress 0
set secondaryRole.advanced.triggerByMouse 0
set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapToPrimary 1
set secondaryRole.advanced.doubletapTime 200
```

The above configuration will trigger the secondary role whenever the dual-role key is pressed for more than 200ms, i.e., just a very slightly prolonged activation will trigger the secondary role.

Furthermore, this configuration allows you to activate the primary role by double-tap-and-hold. You may want this on your space key, or other primary key that is often used to produce a row of characters.

### Advanced key binding

In order to bind an action to a complex shortcut, you can bind an `ifShortcut` macro onto the first key of such shortcut (as already shown above).

In order to bind an action to a sequence of keys, you can use `ifGesture` (as already shown above).
 
In order to rebind keys during runtime, you can also use the `set keymapAction` command. Such bindings will last until keymap reload.

```
set keymapAction.base.15 keystroke left            // map base.j to left arrow    15 is numeric keyid of the j key
set keymapAction.base.16 keystroke down            // map base.k to down arrow    16 is numeric keyid of the k key
set keymapAction.base.17 keystroke right           // map base.l to right arrow   17 is numeric keyid of the l key
set keymapAction.base.08 keystroke up              // map base.i to up arrow      08 is numeric keyid of the i key
```

You may also use similar syntax to bind stuff into module navigation modes. E.g., you may repurpose your mini-trackball to do some vim magic (with `VimMTL` and `VimMTR` macros). 

I.e., if you run the following macro and then roll your keycluster trackball to the right, then every roll event will activate the VimMTR macro.

```
set navigationModeAction.media.left macro VimMTL
set navigationModeAction.media.right macro VimMTR
set navigationModeAction.media.up none
set navigationModeAction.media.down none
set module.keycluster.navigationMode.base media
```

Similarly, you may rebind your touchpad's "right button" by using the following `$onKeymapChange any` macro event:

```
//this needs to go into a macro named `$onKeymapChange any`
set keymapAction.base.192 macro TouchpadLeft
set keymapAction.base.193 macro TouchpadRight
```

### Macro recorder

Runtime macro recorder allows capturing and replaying sequences of scancodes. Each such macro is identified by a number or a character (or `$thisKeyId` which resolves to the `KEYID` of the current key, therefore allowing generic key-associated macros). (Runtime macros are unrelated to the macros that can be created via Agent.)

In this setup, shift+key will start recording (indicated by the "adaptive mode" led), another shift+key will stop recording. Hitting the key alone will then replay the macro (e.g., a simple repetitive text edit). Alternatively, `$thisKeyId` can be used as an argument in order to assign every key to a different slot.

```
ifShift recordMacro $thisKeyId
ifNotShift playMacro $thisKeyId
```

See advanced examples for ways to bind macros in vim-style.

### Strings, variables, and expressions

Write command accepts (not exactly) bash-style interpolated strings. E.g.:

```
write "Current keystrokeDelay is $keystrokeDelay. One plus one is $(1 + 1).\n"
write 'This is a literal "$" character. And here you have an apostrophe '"'"'.'
```

You can save values into named variables via the following syntax:

```
setVar foo 42
write "\$foo value is $foo."
```

You can use your variables, or configuration values in commands. Expressions have to be enclosed in parentheses. E.g. to control led brightness, you may:

```
ifShift autoRepeat set leds.brightness ($leds.brightness * 1.5 + 0.01)
ifNotShift autoRepeat set leds.brightness ($leds.brightness / 1.5)
```

To toggle a boolean config value, you may simply:

```
set leds.enabled (!$leds.enabled)
```

The following operators are accepted:
- `+,-,*,/,%` - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo
- `min(),max()` - minimum, maximum, e.g. `min($a, 2, 3, 4)`
- `<,<=,>,>=` - less than, less or equal, greater than, greater or equal
- `==,!=` - equals, not equals
- `!` - unary boolean negation
- `&&`, `||` - boolean "and" and "or"

### Control flow

_Please see advanced examples for actual usage._

We implement the following standard(ish) control flow constructs:
- `{`, `}` enclosed command blocks. Please note that these are treated like regular commands, so they *have to* be followed by newlines! E.g.:
    ```
    postponeKeys {
        ...
    }
    autoRepeat {
        ...
    }
    ```
- `goTo`, jumping to a c-style label, e.g.:
    ```
    begin:
    ...
    goTo begin
    ```
- `if` / `else`:
    ```
    if ($i > 5) {
        ...
    }
    else if ($i > 1) {
        ...
    }
    else {
        ...
    }
    ```
- `while`, including `break` notation:
    ```
    setVar i 0
    while (true) {
        if ($i > 5) {
            break
        }
        ...
        setVar i ($i+1)
    }
    ```

These constructs can be combined just as all other conditions and modifiers, so neither braces nor parentheses are obligatory. For instance following code is valid (although not very aesthetic and not recommended):
```
ifCtrl if $foo ifShift write "a"
ifCtrl else write "b"
else write "c"
```
or
```
while (true) ifShift write "this *is* valid, but *please* do not do this."
```

### Advanced examples:

#### Cycle through backlight colors.

The following example allows you to cycle through different backlight colors.

In your `$onInit`:

```
setVar backgroundColor 0
```

Then in the macro itself:

```
setVar backgroundColor (($backgroundColor + 1) % 3)        // let the backgroundColor var cycle over values 0, 1 and 2

if ($backgroundColor == 0) {
    set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 255 0 0
}
else if ($backgroundColor == 1) {
    set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 0 255 0
}
else {
    set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 0 0 255
}
```

#### Macro repeat

Let's reimplement vim-like macro repetition. E.g., record macro on key q, then tap `fn+1 fn+3 fn+q`. Observe the macro being performed 13x.

In `$onInit`:

```
setVar macroRepeat 0
```

On keys fn.1 through fn.6:

```
setVar macroRepeat ($macroRepeat*10 + ($keyId - 65))
```

On keys fn.7 through fn.9:
```
setVar macroRepeat ($macroRepeat*10 + $keyId)
```

On fn.0:
```
setVar macroRepeat ($macroRepeat*10)
```

on fn.q (and possibly on all other fn layer characters?):

```
ifShift final recordMacro $thisKeyId          // start or end macro recording by fn+shift+q
if ($macroRepeat == 0) setVar macroRepeat 1   // if number of repetitions was not specified, specify that we should repeat once
while ($macroRepeat > 0) {
    playMacro $thisKeyId
    setVar macroRepeat ($macroRepeat-1)
}
```

#### Vim @ prefix key

If briefly tapped, this macro produces `@@` (play last vim macro). If held, it prepends any other key tap with a `@` key. E.g., `thisMacro + p + p + p` produces `@p@p@p` (play vim macro in register p, thrice).

This example features active wait loops via `goTo $currentAddress` and some postponing queue magic.

```
begin: 
    postponeKeys {                                                           // make sure that other key taps are just queued in postponing queue, but not executed
        ifNotPending 1 ifNotReleased goTo $currentAddress                    // active wait for another key to get pressed
        ifReleased final ifNotInterrupted ifNotPlaytime 300 tapKeySeq @ @    // if this is just a short tap, produce `@@` and finish
        ifPending 1 tapKey @                                                 // there is a key activation in the queue, produce `@`
        setVar savedKey $queuedKeyId.0
    }
    ifPending 1 goTo $currentAddress                        // active wait until the other key press gets executed
    ifKeyActive $savedKey goTo $currentAddress              // active wait until the other key gets released
goTo begin
```

#### Caps words

Simple active wait loop example, to simulate qmk "caps words" - a feature which acts as a caps lock, but automatically turns off on space character:

On activation key:

```
pressKey LS-
setVar capsActive 1                                // let the world know caps words is active
if ($capsActive) goTo $currentAddress              // active wait until space sets the var to 0
//at the end of macro, the shift gets released automatically
```

on space:

```
holdKey space
setVar capsActive 0                                 // signal to the above macro that it should stop holding shift
```

#### Vim Q key

The above examples can be combined into more elaborate setups. Assume we bind the following `perKeyMacro` on every key in our fn layer. Furthermore, assume we bind the following `recordKey` macro onto the `q` key (or `mod-q`). This gives us standard (although incomplete) vim behaviour. Tap `qa` (`mod-q + a`) to start recording a macro in slot "a". Tap `q` (`mod-q`) to end recording. Tap `fn-a` to replay the macro.

```
// perKeyMacro
ifShift final recordMacro $thisKeyId
if ($qActive) final recordMacro $thisKeyId
playMacro $thisKeyId
```

```
// recordKey

ifRecording final stopRecording      // stop recording if already recording
if $qActive final setVar qActive 0   // terminate the "start recording" state if tapped second time

 // signal to perKeyMacro that we want to start recording
setVar qActive 1                                                

// toggle fn layer and keep it active for 5 seconds or until some recordKey instance starts recording a macro
toggleLayer fn                                                   
ifNotRecording ifNotPlaytime 5000 if ($qActive) goTo $currentAddress
untoggleLayer
setVar qActive 0
```

#### Backlight color picker

Colour picker for constant colours. Bound on fn+r, fn+r+r turns colour to red, fn+r+v to violet, etc..

```
ifGesture r final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 255 32 0  // r - red
ifGesture g final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 192 255 0  // g - green
ifGesture b final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 128 192 255 // b - blue
ifGesture y final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 255 192 0 // y - yellow
ifGesture v final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 192 64 255 // v - violet
ifGesture o final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 255 128 0 // o - orange
ifGesture w final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 192 32 0 // w - wine
ifGesture b final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 128 48 0 // b - brown
ifGesture n final set backlight.constantRgb.rgb 255 192 32 // n - warm white, as "normal"
ifGesture f final set backlight.strategy functional // f to functional backlight
ifGesture q final set leds.enabled 0 // q - to turn off
ifGesture p final set leds.enabled 1 // p - to turn back on
```

#### Rotate hues v1

To see all possible UHK hues (maximum saturation), hold a key with the following macro:

```
autoRepeat progressHue
```

#### Rotate hues v2

In order to make UHK slowly rotate through all rainbow colors all the time, you can use the following macro:

```
progressHue
delayUntil 1000
goTo 0
```

#### Rotate hues v3

The above macro will not terminate, not even when ran multiple times. In order to fix this issue, we can use some register signaling:

```
setVar hueStopper 1       // signal other instances of this macro to terminate
delayUntil 2000           // give other instances 2 seconds to terminate (via line 5)
setVar hueStopper 0
while (true) {
    if $hueStopper exit   //if another macro signals us to terminate, do terminate
    progressHue
    delayUntil 1000
}
```

#### Rotate hues from other macros

You can also start this from `$onInit` by `fork rotateHues` (given you have the macro named `rotateHues`). Or add the following lines to the colour picker:

```
// put this at the beginning of the picker, to stop rotateHues when another choice is made.
setVar hueStopper 1
// start the `rotateHues` macro on 'c' - as "changing"
ifGesture c final fork rotateHues
```

### Executing commands over USB

One way is to use the npm script that is packed with agent source code:

1. Build the agent.
2. Navigate to `agent/packages/usb`
3. Execute `./exec-macro-command.ts "write hello world!"`

Or, in linux, you can put the following script into your path... and then use it as `uhkcmd "write hello world!"`:

```
#!/bin/bash
hidraw="hidraw`grep 'UHK 60' /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw*/device/uevent | sed -nE 's/.*hidraw([0-9]+)\/.*/\1/p' | sort -rn | head -n 1`"
echo -e "\x14$*\x00" > "/dev/$hidraw"
```
