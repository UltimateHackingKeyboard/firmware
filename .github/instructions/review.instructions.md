In reviews, please focus on functional aspect, not on nitpicks. 

When encountering a magic constant, think first. Only report it if there is a strong reason for that value to be centralized. E.g., when the value is used in multiple places and may need changing in the future.

Please don't complain about missing comments unless you have a good reason to want a comment at that specific location.
