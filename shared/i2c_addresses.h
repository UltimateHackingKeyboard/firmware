    // In order to minimize the chance of I2C address collisions in the future, an explicit
    // address allocation strategy is utilized. The idea is to spread UHK I2C slaves 8 addresses
    // away from each other. Given that most I2C devices expose at most 3 address pins which
    // is generally equals to a continuous block of 8 addresses, this strategy allows a lot of room
    // when adding further I2C slaves. Fully implementing this strategy is not possible because
    // many slaves only offer a small number of possible addresses, but we should adhere to
    // this strategy as closely as possible by spreading the addresses as much as possible.
